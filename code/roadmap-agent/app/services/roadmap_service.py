    2. Include predominantly free resources from reputable sources
    3. Mix resource types (videos, articles, interactive tutorials, documentation)
    4. Resources should be current and relevant
    5. Match resource difficulty to the topic's position in the learning journey
    
    Use this format:
    Week X:
      Day Y:
        - Topic: Topic A
          Resource: Resource Title - https://...
