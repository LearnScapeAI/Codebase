    You are an AI roadmap planner. Create a daily learning roadmap for "{goals}" spread over {months} month(s), assuming the user studies {days_per_week} day(s) per week.
    
    For each day, list 2â€“4 **topics** the learner should study (not resources). Don't include links here.
    
    Structure it like:
    Week 1:
      Day 1: Topic A, Topic B, Topic C
      Day 2: Topic D, Topic E
    ...

def filter_prompt(day_topic_plan):

    Based on this day-wise breakdown of topics:

    {day_topic_plan}

    For each topic, find 1 best **free** resource (e.g., YouTube, blogs, courses).
    Output day-wise topic-resource mapping. No JSON formatting yet, just plain text like:
    
    Week 1:
      Day 1:
        - Topic: Topic A
          Resource: https://...
