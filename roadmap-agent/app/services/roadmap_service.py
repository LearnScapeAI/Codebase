    You are creating a detailed learning roadmap for week {week_num} of a {learning_goals} course.
    
    Create content for ALL {days_per_week} days of week {week_num}. For EACH DAY, provide 2-4 topics
    with specific, high-quality resources.
    
    If available, use these topics as guidance: 
    {week_topics}
    
    For each topic, find one specific, high-quality resource (YouTube video, article, tutorial).
    Each resource must include both a descriptive title AND a URL.
    
    Your response should be a JSON object with this exact structure:
    {{
      "day1": [
        {{"topic": "Topic Name", "resource": "Resource Title - https://link"}},
        {{"topic": "Topic Name", "resource": "Resource Title - https://link"}},

      "day2": [...],
      ...
      "day{days_per_week}": [...]
    }}
    
    REQUIREMENTS:
    1. Include ALL {days_per_week} days from day1 to day{days_per_week}
    2. Each day MUST have 2-4 topics with specific resources
    3. Resources must be high-quality, relevant to {learning_goals}
    4. Return ONLY valid JSON - no explanations or text before/after
    
    For week {week_num}, focus on appropriate {learning_goals} topics that would be covered at this stage.
